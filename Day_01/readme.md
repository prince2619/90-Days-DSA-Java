# üö© Day 01: Functions, If-Else, Bit Manipulation
‚úÖ What I Learned
Functions: Role, syntax, modularity in Java.

Conditional statements: If-Else structure and decision-making.

Bit Manipulation for addition without + and -.

# ‚ú® Reflections:
Built confidence in function structures and conditionals.

Understood how bit manipulation helps in low-level addition logic.
